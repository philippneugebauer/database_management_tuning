# Database Management and Tuning Code

The code of this project provides the data and facilities to measure and improve database queries.

In particular, the project is splitted into two assignments:
Assignment one measures the different opportunities of data insertion by [multiple INSERT queries](https://github.com/philippneugebauer/database_management_tuning/blob/master/DTM_Assignment_1/src/main/java/it/unibz/dtm/assignment1/flp/Task1.java), the [batch execution](https://github.com/philippneugebauer/database_management_tuning/blob/master/DTM_Assignment_1/src/main/java/it/unibz/dtm/assignment1/flp/Task22.java) of INSERT queries and the [COPY statement](https://github.com/philippneugebauer/database_management_tuning/blob/master/DTM_Assignment_1/src/main/java/it/unibz/dtm/assignment1/flp/Task21.java)

Assignment two first [generates the data](https://github.com/philippneugebauer/database_management_tuning/blob/master/DMT_Assignment_2/src/main/java/it/unibz/dtm/assignment2/flp/CreateData.java) for the tests and then [measures](https://github.com/philippneugebauer/database_management_tuning/blob/master/DMT_Assignment_2/src/main/java/it/unibz/dtm/assignment2/flp/QueryTesting.java) the influence of the design of SELECT queries.

## Gradle

The code supports Gradle and therefore the generation of Eclipse/IDEA files.
